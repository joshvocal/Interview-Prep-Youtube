## Algorithms

* [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
  * Top Down
    * Recursive
    * Memoization - Memoization refers to the technique of caching and reusing previously computed results
  * Bottom Up
    * Iterative
    * Tabulation - Tabulation is similar in the sense that it builds up a cache, but the approach is different. A tabulation algorithm focuses on filling the entries of the cache, until the target value has been reached.
